Project Title:  Retail foot traffic patterns through Foursquare checkins

Team members:  Nelson Leung, Faz Naimov, Greyson Ford

Project Description:  Analysis of foot traffic patterns and user information for specific retail locations and/or categories using Places API.  Potential enrichment with additional data sources, time permitting

Research question to be answered:  What are the demographics of specific locations and is there a correlation to foot traffic patterns (TBC pending confirmation of data availability)

Data sets to be used:  
- Foursquare Places API
- NYU Spatial Data Repository

Hypothesis:

We expect music venues to have clustered together over time to create pockets of similar type venues in the same area.  Similarly, we expect neighborhoods with more defined musical identities will have higher ratings because of the sense of community it harbors.

Questions:
1 - What are the most popular neighborhoods for music venues in New York City?
2 - What are the most popular venues by neighborhood?
3 - Which neighborhoods have the most highly rated/most liked venues?
4 - Which music venues have the most likes/highest ratings?
